# Snake-Game

Snake game is a game that has marked the childhood of many. The principle is quite simple: move the head of a snake, allowing it to reach its food, which increases in length with each feeding. The trick is to make sure that the snake's head doesn't bite the edge of the field, or even worse, that the snake bites itself! 

It's up to you!
